# Stock_price_prediction_by_Q_table_learning
The main goal of this project is about using Q learning table as an agent in stock trading. 
In fact, this agent doesn't work well, it's just an toy model.
# Running code
Usage of code: you can define paramter as you want. The first parameter is size of sliding windows in time; \
second parameter is number of level, which discretizes state into different levels; third parameter is number \
of epsisode. \
For example
```
python run_this ^GSPC 5 6 2
```
